# QALSH: Query-Aware Locality-Sensitive Hashing

Version: 1.4.0

Release date:  03-10-2017

Last Modified: 25-04-2018


Introduction
--------

This package is written in the C++ programming language. It contains two 
external LSH schemes QALSH and QALSH+ for high-dimensional c-Approximate 
Nearest Neighbor (or simply c-ANN) search under l_p norm, where p \in 
(0, 2].


Usage
--------

We provide a Makefile and a shell script (i.e., run_mnist.sh) as a running 
example for comipling and running the package. Before running this package, 
please ensure the input format of the dataset and query set is correct. We 
give a sample dataset and query set (i.e., Mnist) for your reference.

We also share the shell scripts (i.e., run_sift.sh, run_gist.sh, run_trevi.sh, 
and run_p53.sh) for the users who would like to reproduce the results presented 
in PVLDB 2015 and VLDBJ 2017. The datasets Sift, Gist, Trevi, and P53 we used 
can be downloaded from the following links:
